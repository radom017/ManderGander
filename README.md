# ManderGander
This project is intended to provide a user-friendly means of parameterizing mechanistic niche models for amphibians, but particularly for terrestrial salamanders. A second goal is to develop a "general" mechanistic niche model for salamanders based on macrophysiology, allometry, and biophysics.
